Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mauro Mancinetti and I'm a Java developer since 20 years or so.

In my career I had the opportunity to approach different program languages but Java is the one I've used the most. I've built web applications based on frameworks like Struts, Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate and Tapestry but also just using Java standard technologies such as Java Servlets or Java Portlets.

I definitely have more than Java to offer, in fact, Python, Linux Bash scripting, Sql, Html, Css, Kotlin, Javascript and so on have been part of my journey together with taking care of testing, network administration and devop tasks throughout my career. This made me an all rounded developer and with my last experience as a Team Leader as well, I am pretty dynamic with tasks and responsibilities without fear jumping from Jira, Confluence, Agile Sprint meetings and many zoom calls to coding till late.

Looking forward to learn more technologies and collaborate with passionate people like me.
